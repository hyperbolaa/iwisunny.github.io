The news makes it seem like hackers are always up to no good, breaking into computer networks and stealing data, generally causing chaos.
The news only tells part of the story, those are Black-hat hacks, there's also gray hat &amp; white hat hackers, and [redhat](http://www.redhat.com/) hackers too.
In fact, if you've ever solved a problem, a hacker is you!
