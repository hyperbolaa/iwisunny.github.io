1. Colors
I hate using the eyedropper tool to try to select the exact right pixel to guess
at the colors of your fonts, borders, and really any other element. Your colors are
imporant to your design, make sure to communicate what they are.
2. Typography
  # Typographic Scale (h1-h6)
     How will the fonts work together? a good baseline is 16px, it's the default
     in most browsers. A well-coded site will use EMs instead of pixels, and devs
     are lazy and don't like to use math (even simple division.)
3. Branding
    What's your logo? Where should it go? Is it a scalable vector format?
