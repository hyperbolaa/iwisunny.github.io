Patents were an excellent idea, write out how you did something new and different, and
you could register for a limited monopopoly on that development. After your monopoly ran out
others could then look at your patent and come up with new ideas based on your old work.

The fashion industry doesn't use patents or copyright, it's too expensive and time consuming to use IP law to lock up the design of a t-shirt or a necklace or the cut of a dress. 
Not that some elements in the fashion haven't tried, mostly to prevent counterfeit products.
Every year thousands of knock-offs are sold world-wide, and it hasn't hurt the industry a bit. How can this be if innovation has to be tied up
in legal mumbo-jumbo? Simple: fashion changes. The market is too busy shipping new product & raking in the dough to lock up all the old stuff.

Every year a new set of colors and styles is strutted in high fashion shows in New York, LA, Paris,
and Milan. Frivolent costumes and simple shapes in a bevy of colors and patterns. Every year the combinations
change based solely on the whims of the high fashion designer. You are your brand, and your reputation is at 
stake. The high fashion designers cuts and colors are then replicated by high-end stores, who are copied by 
regular retailers, who eventually get cloned by bargain retailers. Each step of the industry is supported by the step before it
as ideas spread to the masses. And all these companies somehow manage to stay in business, even with their "Intellectual Property" being "stolen!"

This was the ideal of the Atomic age capitalism presided over by the Greatest Generation. Every year designers would
produce everything from new toasters to cars, each pushing the boundaries of product design. Futuristic radios that looked
as well suited on a space-ship as they did next to a sleak console hi-fi system. The designs and implementations varied
wildly as new technologies and cultural whims were discovered. Everything changed just as much as it stayed the same.
Sure there was progress, but technological innovation is a lot slower than artistic innovation, illusory progress drives the sales, much like we're seeing with android &amp; iOS's latest and greatest updates.

There's only 12 notes in the western musical scale, yet everything from Mozart to the Beatles to Method Man can be found within. 
Each of these musical examples builds upon the past to progress into the future of music; and again this gets old quick, expecially if you listen to the [top 40](http://www.billboard.com/charts/pop-songs).

Currently though in the tech industry patents aren't generally used for diseminating information, but to protect it from competition.
[As Apple did in it's recent cases against Samsung](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57423627-37/apple-v-samsung-50-suits-10-countries-and-counting/).
Apple tried to litigate away competition, and prevent their product from going to market by filing injuntions against Samsung.
Apples [not the only one](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=patent+war) tied up in this Google, Motorola, RIM, pretty much the entire smartphone market has been in court
over some patent.
But there are even more subversive agents in the IP law game, [Patent Trolls](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=patent+troll). All they do is use patents to try to sue their way
into tech wealth. Some have purchased overly-broad patents and made claims that they [own podcasting](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130206/07215421891/patent-troll-says-it-owns-podcasting-sues-adam-carolla-howstuffworks.shtml)
or [putting recipes online](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120615/03122319332/patent-holder-sues-basically-anyone-who-offers-recipes-meal-planning-online.shtml).

There are only so many ways to cut a shirt, toast bread, or arrange notes, just as there are only so many ways to write a program, especially one that sends text over the internet.
We can all prosper if we let information flow freely. Why hold onto your baby forever? Once it matures (or not), set it free to the world.
