Here is a base-template I created for use on car dealership mobile sites. It's a
minimalist design, made to work on the widest variety of software/firmware
possible from your favorite flip-phone to a top-of-the-line blackberry. This template was developed to launch quickly, if the dealer had an
existing site, it was simply a the flick of the switch to launch. To maximize
compatibility there is no JavaScript used on this, since only 
smartphones support it in a reasonable fashion. Every step through this project was fully optimized
for load time on non-3G networks.
