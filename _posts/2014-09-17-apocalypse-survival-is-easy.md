I'm quite suprized at how easy it is to survive the end-times as predicted by mediums, prophets, clergy, mathemeticians, charlatans, and true-believers.
In 2012, it was the Mayan Calendar predictions, which were largely ignored - and later denounced - especially by Mayans living today.
In 2011, it was Harold Camping predicting first May 21st, and when that fell through October 21st, would be the end-times as seen in Revelations.
In ancient Rome there was a prophecy that 12 eagles revealed to Romulus the lifespan of Rome. 
Many believed each eagle to represent 10 years, bringing the end in 634 BCE; others thought the eagles represented days in a year setting the end in 389 BCE.
These sorts of predictions are often made, and sometimes become popular in some circles but hardly ever come true.
Some people are unduly distressed when they find themselves soon to be facing the end of the universe as we know it in a massive cosmic event, so I've decided to try and quell their fears.
Maybe knowing you've likely survived a dozen or more moments of universal doom will also give you solace, knowing that the next time the world faces the final judgement probably won't be the last.
