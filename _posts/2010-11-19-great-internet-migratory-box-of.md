If you didn't know [The Great Internet Migratory Box Of Electronics
Junk](http://tgimboej.org/) is a project that allows hackers & makers to share
some electronics/components with each other. There's a ton of these things
going around, but it seems like they move quite slowly.


 I received the box code-named [_Baltimore
Bazaar_](http://tgimboej.org/Box_Code:_Baltimore_Bazaar) a few days ago &
busted it open immediately; nothing really caught my eye in there, a few
motors, a battery charger and a bunch of small components EVERYWHERE. I had to
pick a bunch of capacitors and screws out of one of the motors I decided to
play with, but there was nothing in there I really wanted or needed.


I took a 2GB SD card out (I'm planning on adding the [Homebrew
Channel](http://hbc.hackmii.com/) to my Wii), and replaced it with a couple
old-school RCA transistors, a small geared motor, a 20Q game (needs a new
battery), and a few ICs. I think I saw somewhere that you could hack the 20Q
device, I'm sure somebody can find a use for it.


Hopefully I get another box sometime in the future, it was fun trying to
figure out what everything is. Perhaps the next one will be more useful to me;
maybe I'll even split it, I've certainly got enough junk!
