[Bhajis Loops](http://soundcloud.com/jkirchartz/sets/bhajis-loops) by [jkirchartz](http://soundcloud.com/jkirchartz)  

Here's a collection of samples, doodles, runs, and maybe a few songs I made
using [Bhajis Loops](http://www.chocopoolp.com/), export to `*.wav`, on an old
Palm Tungsten E2 they're CC-licensed so please feel free to
sample & chop them as you see fit.
